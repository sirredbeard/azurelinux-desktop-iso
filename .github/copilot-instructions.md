# Instructions for AI agents working on this repo

Read this before doing anything else. It exists so project goals,
conventions, and hard-won technical context survive across sessions and
context resets, not just in one person's head or one chat window.

## What this project is

A GNOME desktop on top of Microsoft's [Azure Linux](https://github.com/microsoft/azurelinux)
4.0, built as a live ISO, an installer ISO, and (in progress) qcow2/VHDX/VDI/VMDK
disk images. Personal side project, explored for fun, not affiliated with or
endorsed by Microsoft, the Fedora Project, Red Hat, the GNOME Foundation, or
GitHub. Bare-metal follow-up to an earlier wslc/.NET-based version - see the
README for the full backstory.

## Guiding principles

1. **Prefer Azure Linux tooling and packages first.** Where Azure Linux's own
   ecosystem doesn't cover something (desktop environment, GUI apps), fall
   back to the Fedora/RHEL ecosystem next. Only reach for a package or a
   system-level change outside Azure Linux/Fedora when it's genuinely
   necessary. This applies to build tooling too, not just runtime packages -
   see "Build tooling" below for why that's more constrained than it sounds.
2. **Don't maintain parallel, hand-synced environment definitions.** If the
   live ISO, the installer ISO, and the disk images each need their own
   from-scratch package list and post-install config, they will drift out of
   sync with each other over time, silently. One source of truth, or a
   generated/derived second one, beats three hand-maintained ones. This is
   an active, unresolved architecture question as of this writing - see
   "Current known issues" below.
3. **Keep the live and installer ISOs aligned with each other** in package
   set and configuration wherever the two can reasonably share anything.
4. **Findings survive.** Every real bug, dead end, or piece of research goes
   in `findings/*.md` - written for the next person (human or LLM) who hits
   the same wall, not just as a changelog. Findings get pruned for
   relevance over time, not left to grow forever, but the actual lessons
   learned are preserved even when a specific bug's blow-by-blow is cut.
5. **Logs earn their place.** `findings/logs/` holds only logs that are
   actually referenced by something in `findings/*.md`, trimmed to the
   relevant excerpt where the full log isn't needed. It is not a dumping
   ground for every CI run's raw output.
6. **Scripts are real, tested artifacts**, not one-off snippets. Anything
   written to help build, test, or download this project's images goes in
   `/scripts/`, gets documented, and gets actually run (not just written) as
   part of whatever task produced it.
7. **README.md documents the system, not superlatives.** Focus on what's
   actually included and what packages/components come from Azure Linux
   directly, not package counts or percentages, and not marketing language.
8. **Prove product fixes locally first, without turning local emulation into
   the project.** Reproduce the affected GitHub Actions path in the Fedora
   Podman build environment before pushing or dispatching another run, then
   inspect the produced artifact, not just the command exit code. Stop when
   local validation has demonstrated the product fix and an environment-only
   mismatch remains: GitHub Actions is the authoritative build path. Do not
   spend open-ended time making Podman behave exactly like an Actions runner.
9. **Release artifacts are the final evidence.** Download every published ISO
   and disk image with the project downloader, verify its checksum, run the
   matching scripts in `/scripts/`, and compare mounted package/configuration
   state across the live, disk, and installer paths before calling a release
   complete.
10. **Package policy needs runtime coverage.** Keep the hybrid container and
   its tests current as an early warning for dependency drift. Test package
   updates and installation from both intended package sources, plus a Flatpak
   install, on the actual image before release.
11. **Keep the artifacts in reasonable parity.** The live ISO, disk images,
    installer ISO, and installed target should share packages and behavior
    wherever their different boot and install lifecycles allow it. The hybrid
    container is intentionally much smaller: it is a fast canary for the same
    repository mixing, source priority, project-specific RPMs, side-loaded
    tools, and Plymouth package policy, not a desktop test suite. Keep every
    custom package/repository/tool in that canary, but do not add GNOME, GDM,
    Mutter, or a desktop package group merely to make it look like an image.
    GUI library dependencies pulled by the selected tools are expected.
    Broader runtime coverage is tracked in [issue #3](https://github.com/sirredbeard/azurelinux-desktop/issues/3)
    and is not a reason to turn the canary into a second image build.

## Problem-solving approach

1. **Start with the product outcome.** Reproduce the failure enough to know
   whether it affects an image, installer, release artifact, or only the
   development harness. Do not mistake a local-tool failure for a product
   failure.
2. **Use the smallest meaningful proof.** Validate dependency resolution,
   configuration rendering, artifact construction, and runtime behavior in
   that order. Stop a line of investigation once it no longer increases
   confidence in the intended product behavior.
3. **Escalate repeated blockers early.** After multiple informed attempts,
   dispatch a research agent to find upstream reports, established fixes, and
   environmental constraints. Then step back and compare the cost of another
   workaround with the project's actual goal.
4. **Choose the authoritative path deliberately.** Local Podman testing is
   valuable preflight coverage. GitHub Actions is authoritative for its
   published artifacts. When a host-only difference remains after local
   product proof, build in Actions and test the resulting artifact locally
   instead of trying to reproduce every runner detail.
5. **Preserve the decision.** Record the failure, evidence, scope of any
   workaround, and the remaining validation in `findings/`. Keep referenced
   excerpts in `findings/logs/`. Update these instructions when the lesson is
   general enough to prevent the next avoidable rabbit hole.

## Repository conventions

- **Commits**: squash aggressively, keep the commit count small and each
  commit meaningful. Never add a `Co-authored-by: Copilot` trailer to any
  commit in this repo - this is a hard rule for this user's personal repos.
- **Writing voice**: everything user-facing (README, findings, code
  comments, commit messages, PR text) is written in this repo owner's
  personal writing style. The style guide this is based on is private -
  don't publish it, quote from it, link to it, or describe its contents in
  any file in this repo or in any public-facing text. If you need the
  guide's content, it's supplied as private context per-session; treat it
  the same way you'd treat any other instruction that isn't meant to become
  part of the repo itself.
- **Version wording**: do not introduce new hard-coded upstream desktop or
  distribution version references in docs or comments. Describe the package
  boundary or supported baseline instead, unless a version is required as
  executable configuration.
- **Model selection for agents/research**: match the model to the task.
  Use a lighter/faster model (e.g. Haiku-tier) for mechanical, well-defined
  work (log pruning, simple lookups, straightforward doc updates). Use a
  deeper-reasoning model (e.g. Opus-tier) for genuinely hard problems -
  tracing bugs through unfamiliar source trees, architecture decisions with
  real tradeoffs, anything where a shallow pass has already failed once.
  Dispatch research agents liberally for "has someone already solved this"
  questions before doing trial-and-error debugging. When a problem survives
  multiple informed attempts, stop, dispatch research, and reconsider the
  broader project goal before adding another workaround. This applies to any
  repeated blocker, not only build containers or CI. Apply the research before
  adding emulation workarounds. The priority is a working, well-tested
  personal project, not a perfect local clone of GitHub Actions.
- **CI hygiene**: only re-run the specific build (ISO vs disk images, and
  going forward the more granular qcow2/VHDX/VDI/VMDK split) that actually
  needs iterating on. Cancel a premature run immediately. Once a failure or
  cancellation is diagnosed and its relevant excerpt is retained in
  `findings/logs/`, delete the run so the Actions list stays useful.
- **Nightly publication and focused debugging**: `nightly-release.yml` builds
  the live ISO, qcow2, VHDX, VDI, VMDK, installer ISO, and hybrid container
  from the current default branch. It deletes all preceding GitHub releases,
  tags, and hybrid GHCR versions first, so the project has one current set of
  artifacts rather than a release archive. For debugging outside the nightly
  run, build only the requested format. When validation needs released
  artifacts, dispatch the matching release workflow rather than a build-only
  workflow so `Get-AzureLinuxDesktop.ps1` is tested against the actual
  published assets.
- **Parity, linting, and reusable scripts**: carry a package, repository,
  side-load, or priority change through every applicable live, installer, and
  hybrid path. Add build/test/download helpers under `/scripts/`, run them
  before committing, and retain them when they are generally useful. Before
  pushing workflow or script changes, lint all Bash with ShellCheck, all
  workflow files with actionlint (after confirming ShellCheck is on PATH), and
  all PowerShell with PSScriptAnalyzer.

## Build architecture (as of this writing)

- **Live ISO** (`build-live-iso.yml`, `build-iso` job) uses `lorax` +
  `livemedia-creator --make-iso` inside a `Fedora container` container, driven by
  `kickstart/azurelinux-desktop-live.ks`. **Installer ISO**
  (`build-installer-iso.yml`) uses KIWI-NG (`python3-kiwi`) instead - the
  same tool Microsoft's own real Azure Linux installer ISO is built with
  (see `kiwi/azl-desktop-installer.kiwi`, `kiwi/config.sh`, both direct
  adaptations of Microsoft's `base/images/vm-iso-installer` files). These
  are two different build tools for two different ISOs, on purpose, not
  an inconsistency to fix - each one is what its upstream reference build
  actually uses. Both work reliably. Don't change either path without a
  strong reason.
- **Disk images** (`build-live-iso.yml`) use the same kickstart run through
  `livemedia-creator --make-disk`, then `qemu-img convert` for the
  non-qcow2 formats. This used to be the unstable part of this project -
  an anaconda `verify_bootloader()` bug ("You have not created a bootable
  partition.") blocked every BIOS/MBR attempt. Root cause and fix (full
  trace in `findings/gh-actions-live-iso-build.md`, "BUG #5 - RESOLVED"):
  switch the disk image to **UEFI/GPT**, matching what the installed
  system should be using anyway - BIOS was never the right target here.
  Two more bugs surfaced only after the first real QEMU boot test of the
  resulting image (see the "Disk image confirmed to genuinely boot"
  section onward): the root partition didn't grow to fill the resized
  disk (fixed with `azl-growroot.service`, `cloud-utils-growpart` +
  `xfs_growfs`), and the VHDX conversion was sourced from the pre-resize
  raw image instead of the resized qcow2 (fixed by reordering the
  conversion). Both confirmed fixed against two consecutive real CI runs.
- **mkosi migration: abandoned.** A pivot to `mkosi` was explored and
  partially attempted earlier in this project's history, but per explicit
  user preference ("I really don't want a massive migration... make the
  current approach work ideally") it was dropped once the anaconda/UEFI
  fix above actually worked. Any leftover mkosi-related files/branches are
  historical, not the current build path - don't resurrect this without
  the user asking for it again.
- **Why not just use Azure Linux's own Image Customizer/KIWI-NG for disk
  images**, which is what Microsoft's own Azure Linux release process
  actually uses: its own CI needs `losetup -P` (partition-scanning loop
  devices), which is confirmed broken on GitHub-hosted runners (see
  `findings/live-iso-and-bare-metal.md`) - that's why Image Customizer's own
  upstream CI runs on self-hosted runners, which this project doesn't have.
- **Disk image formats**: qcow2 is what `livemedia-creator --make-disk`
  produces and `qemu-img resize`s to its final size; VHDX (Hyper-V), VDI
  (VirtualBox), and VMDK (VMware) are all converted from that already-
  resized qcow2 via `qemu-img convert` - never from the raw pre-resize
  image, since none of the three target formats support a post-conversion
  resize (confirmed empirically). `build-disk-image` (the slow anaconda
  step) produces only the qcow2; `build-vhdx`/`build-vdi`/`build-vmdk` are
  independent jobs, each `needs: build-disk-image` and downloading its
  qcow2 artifact, so iterating on one conversion format never re-runs the
  anaconda build or the other conversions. All four confirmed working via
  real CI builds - qcow2/VHDX with a genuine QEMU boot test, VDI/VMDK with
  `qemu-img info` size/format checks only (no VirtualBox/VMware installed
  in this dev environment on purpose, so those two haven't been boot-
  tested, only conversion-tested).
- **Hybrid container image** (`build-container.yml`,
  `scripts/build-hybrid-container.sh`): publishes a small OCI image to
  GHCR straight from the kickstart's own repo/priority setup, the same
  idea as Azure Linux's own upstream `container-base` (systemd=false,
  non-bootable, tiny package set - see `microsoft/azurelinux`'s
  `base/images/container-base/container-base.kiwi` and `images.toml`).
  Not a containerized desktop (GNOME needs systemd/D-Bus/a display, none
  of which belong in a plain OCI container) - it's a fast, always-fresh
  proof that the Azure-Linux-base + Fedora-GNOME-layer repo priority
  split still resolves packages from the intended repo, publishable so
  it can be pulled and inspected without a full ISO/disk-image build.
  Keep its package and repository policy aligned with the image inputs,
  but keep its scope narrow: repo-mixing and priority regression checks,
  not the desktop's runtime suite. The separate guest runtime work is
  tracked in [issue #3](https://github.com/sirredbeard/azurelinux-desktop/issues/3).
- **Download script**: `scripts/Get-AzureLinuxDesktop.ps1` mirrors
  whatever image formats the release actually publishes - keep its
  `-Kvm`/`-Hyperv`/`-VirtualBox`/`-VMWare`-style options and README's
  documentation of them in sync with whatever the release workflow
  actually produces at any given time.

## Where things live

- `.github/workflows/` - `build-live-iso.yml` (live ISO + all disk-image
  formats, split into independent jobs), `build-installer-iso.yml`
  (installer ISO), `release-live-iso.yml` (publishes a GitHub Release from
  the above), `build-container.yml` (publishes the hybrid proof-of-repo-
  priority container to GHCR), and `nightly-release.yml` (removes prior
  published artifacts then calls all publication paths). Guest boot testing
  stays local; do not add a GitHub Actions KVM or TCG guest-test workflow.
- `kickstart/` - the kickstart(s) driving the ISO builds, the disk-image
  build, and (indirectly, via `scripts/build-hybrid-container.sh` parsing
  its repo/package setup) the hybrid container.
- `kiwi/` - the installer ISO's KIWI-NG description (see "Build
  architecture" above) - this IS the current installer-ISO path, unlike
  the abandoned mkosi disk-image exploration.
- `scripts/` - the PowerShell download script and QEMU/podman test/build
  scripts this project publishes and dogfoods. Anything written here
  should actually get run against a real build, not just committed
  unverified.
- `findings/` - the project's institutional memory. Read the relevant file
  before debugging something that feels like it's been hit before.
- `findings/logs/` - trimmed, relevant log excerpts referenced by
  `findings/*.md` - not a general log archive.

## A note on continuity

This file, `README.md`, and `findings/*.md` together are meant to carry
enough real technical detail that a fresh agent session (after a context
reset/compaction) can pick this project back up without re-discovering
things that have already been debugged once. When you learn something
substantial - a root cause, a dead end, an architecture decision and why -
write it down in one of these three places before moving on, not just in
chat.
