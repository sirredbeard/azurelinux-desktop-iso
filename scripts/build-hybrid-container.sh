# Builds a small OCI container image straight from this project's own
# repo/priority setup, the same idea as Azure Linux's own upstream
# container-base (microsoft/azurelinux base/images/container-base/
# container-base.kiwi): a tiny, non-bootable, no-systemd image that
# ships nothing but the release/repo package plus whatever it's there
# to demonstrate. Their `core` container is base-only (filesystem,
# bash, azurelinux-release-container, azurelinux-repos); ours adds the
# one thing this project actually exists to prove - that the
# Azure-Linux-base + Fedora44-GNOME-layer repo priority split in
# kickstart/azurelinux-desktop-live.ks resolves cleanly and keeps
# picking packages from the intended repo, not just at ISO-build time.
#
# This is NOT a container version of the full desktop - a GNOME
# session needs a running systemd, D-Bus, and a display, none of which
# make sense in a plain OCI container. It's a lightweight, publishable
# proof of the repo-priority mechanism, small enough to build and push
# on every run, and pullable by anyone who wants to inspect/test the
# hybrid resolution without building a full ISO or disk image.
#
# Reuses the exact repo --name=... parsing approach from
# scripts/podman-test-azl4-fedora44.sh (see that script's comments for
# why: always test/ship what the kickstart actually says, never a
# hand-maintained second copy of it).
#
# Usage (from repo root, needs podman or buildah):
#   ./scripts/build-hybrid-container.sh [image-ref]
#
# image-ref defaults to localhost/azurelinux-desktop-hybrid:latest.
# Set PUSH=1 (and have already `podman login`'d) to push it too - the
# GitHub Actions workflow does this against ghcr.io.
