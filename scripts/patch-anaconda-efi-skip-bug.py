"""Patch anaconda-core's efi.py to fix a real skip-path return-value bug.

Fedora 44's packaged anaconda-core (44.30-2.fc44, the version dnf5 installs
into the fedora:44 build container for the disk-image job) still carries a
bug upstream already fixed on rhinstaller/anaconda's main branch:

bootloader/efi.py's efibootmgr() is supposed to skip the real efibootmgr
call for image/directory installs (there is no hardware NVRAM to write to
in that case) and return a value the caller can safely check. The installed
version does `return ""` unconditionally on that skip path, but
_add_single_efi_boot_target() does `if rc != 0: raise` - and `"" != 0` is
always True in Python, so every image-mode EFI install fails with "Failed
to set new efi boot target. This is most likely a kernel or firmware bug."
even though nothing actually went wrong.

Upstream's fix (confirmed via a GitHub source search of
rhinstaller/anaconda main) pops "capture" up front and returns
`"" if capture_expected else 0` on both skip paths, so a non-capturing
caller sees a falsy 0 instead of a truthy non-zero string. This script
applies that same fix in place, before livemedia-creator ever runs
anaconda, rather than wait for Fedora to backport it.

Run inside the fedora:44 build container, after `dnf5 install
anaconda-core` and before `livemedia-creator --make-disk` runs. See
findings/gh-actions-live-iso-build.md for the full bug writeup.
