# Boot a built azurelinux-desktop-live.iso in QEMU for manual testing, with
# a real GTK window (not -nographic/VNC) so the desktop can actually be
# looked at, plus a QEMU monitor socket for scripted checks (screendump,
# system_powerdown, etc.) alongside just watching the window directly.
#
# This is the exact invocation used to test GH Actions run 3's ISO - it's
# recorded here so it doesn't have to be re-derived from scratch (or from
# session history) every time. Usage:
#
#   ./scripts/qemu-test-live-iso.sh /path/to/azurelinux-desktop-live.iso
#
# Notes learned the hard way:
#   - DISPLAY must point at a real, already-running X/Wayland session on
#     this host (-display gtk opens an actual window there) - this only
#     works when run from/against a graphical desktop session, not a
#     headless SSH-only box.
#   - The QEMU monitor's own `screendump` command produces visibly
#     corrupted/striped PPM captures in this environment (a capture-path
#     artifact, not a guest bug) - don't trust screendump PNGs/PPMs for
#     pixel-level verification. Looking directly at the real GTK window
#     (or having a human screenshot it) is the reliable way to check
#     on-screen state; screendump is only good for coarse checks like
#     "did grub load" via readable text.
#   - -m 4096 (4GB) reproduced a live-session "out of disk space" report
#     within minutes of testing flatpak installs - that's dracut's RAM-
#     backed tmpfs overlay for the live root, sized as a fraction of
#     total VM RAM, not a real free-space problem. Give the VM more RAM
#     (8192+) if you intend to install/test anything substantial in the
#     live session itself, or add rd.live.overlay.size=/rd.live.ram=
#     kernel args - see findings/ for the details.
#   - A second virtio drive (a throwaway qcow2) is attached so there's a
#     writable disk present at boot in case the installable variant or
#     any persistence testing needs one later; the live ISO itself boots
#     and runs entirely from the -cdrom device.
#   - -cpu host is required, not optional. Without it QEMU defaults to
#     -cpu qemu64 even with -enable-kvm, a conservative baseline missing
#     SSE4.1/SSE4.2/POPCNT - real modern CPU features .NET's runtime
#     expects and hard-crashes without ("Fatal error. The current CPU is
#     missing one or more of the following instruction sets..."). This
#     was mistaken for a .NET/dotnet.desktop problem at first; it's a
#     test-VM CPU model problem, not a build problem.
