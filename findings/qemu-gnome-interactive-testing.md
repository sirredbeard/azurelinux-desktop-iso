# QEMU + GNOME Wayland Interactive Testing: Quirks, Gotchas, and Rules of Thumb

Notes from interactive testing of the Azure Linux Desktop live ISO via QEMU monitor
(screendump + sendkey + mouse_move) on a Fedora host. Accumulated 2026-07-22/23.

## QEMU Launch

### Must-have flags

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -enable-kvm -m 8G -smp 4 -cpu host \          # see CPU note below
  -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly=on,file=/usr/share/edk2/ovmf/OVMF_CODE.fd \
  -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file="$WORKDIR/OVMF_VARS.fd" \
  -drive file="$ISO",media=cdrom,readonly=on,if=ide \
  -device usb-ehci -device usb-tablet \          # absolute mouse coords
  -net nic,model=virtio -net user \
  -vga virtio -display vnc=127.0.0.1:1 \
  -monitor unix:"$WORKDIR/monitor.sock",server,nowait \
  -serial file:"$WORKDIR/serial.log" \
  -daemonize -pidfile "$WORKDIR/qemu.pid"
```

**`-cpu host`** — required for .NET. The default `qemu64` CPU model lacks SSE4.1,
SSE4.2, and POPCNT; .NET 9+ aborts at startup with:
```
Fatal error.
The current CPU is missing one or more of the following instruction sets:
SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, POPCNT
```
With `-cpu host`, the host CPU extensions are passed through and .NET runs fine.

**`-device usb-ehci -device usb-tablet`** — without this, `mouse_move` sends
relative deltas that drift randomly. With usb-tablet, coordinates are absolute
pixels on the guest framebuffer. Both devices are required; usb-tablet alone
does not work without usb-ehci on the same bus.

**`-m 8G`** — 4G is enough to boot but leaves only ~783 MB for the OverlayFS
upper tmpfs. This is tight enough that a Flatpak install OOMs the guest and
causes a silent reset. 8G gives ~1.5G overlay headroom.

**`-vga virtio`** — required for GNOME Wayland. With `-vga std` or `-vga qxl`,
GNOME either fails to start or renders blank windows. virtio-vga is the only
card that works reliably with the live ISO's KMS/DRM stack.

**VNC port reuse** — after killing a QEMU instance, the VNC port `:1` (5901)
may not be released immediately. Wait ~2 seconds before starting a new instance
or you get `Address already in use`. Keep one instance running at a time.

### Reboot rule of thumb

Kill and restart QEMU whenever:
- "Display output is not active" persists after mouse/key input
- The guest OOM-killed itself (signs: serial log stops mid-boot or at BdsDxe, screendump returns all-black after GNOME was up)
- Input stops working in an app that previously accepted it
- GNOME appears to have crashed (top bar disappears, desktop turns solid color)

Rebooting is faster than diagnosing a broken QEMU/guest state.

---

## Screendumps

### How to take one

```bash
printf "screendump /path/out.ppm\n" | socat - "UNIX-CONNECT:$SOCK" >/dev/null 2>&1
convert /path/out.ppm /path/out.png && rm /path/out.ppm
```

Always convert to PNG immediately; PPM files are large (~3 MB each).

### "Display output is not active"

This QEMU VNC message appears in the screendump when:
1. The guest hasn't initialized virtio-vga yet (early UEFI/GRUB phase)
2. GNOME's display server has crashed or been killed
3. The guest itself has reset/rebooted and is back in UEFI POST

It is NOT a QEMU crash — the QEMU process is still running. Check
`info status` via the monitor socket to confirm. Check the serial log to see
how far along the boot is.

---

## Keyboard Input

### sendkey rules

- Use `sendkey <key>` via the monitor socket.
- Letters: `sendkey a`, `sendkey b`, etc. (lowercase only; uppercase = `sendkey shift-a`)
- Space: `sendkey spc`
- Hyphen/dash: `sendkey minus`
- Dot: `sendkey dot`
- Slash: `sendkey slash`
- Underscore: `sendkey shift-minus`
- Enter/Return: `sendkey ret`
- Backspace: `sendkey backspace`
- Tab: `sendkey tab`
- Escape: `sendkey esc`
- Alt+F4: `sendkey alt-f4`
- Super/Meta/Windows key: `sendkey key_leftmeta` (**not** `sendkey super` — that doesn't work reliably)

### Bash word-splitting gotcha with type_line

When building a `type_line` function with `for c in $(echo "$line" | fold -w1)`,
bash word-splitting eats spaces — `"gh --version"` becomes `"gh"` then `"--version"`
typed as one run with no space. The fix is to use bash substring indexing:

```bash
type_line() {
    local line="$1"; local i=0
    while [ $i -lt ${#line} ]; do
        local c="${line:$i:1}"
        case "$c" in
            ' ') sendkey spc ;; '-') sendkey minus ;; '.') sendkey dot ;;
            '/') sendkey slash ;; *) sendkey "$c" ;;
        esac
        i=$(( i + 1 ))
    done
    sendkey ret
}
```

### Looking Glass evaluator: `sendkey period` / `sendkey dot` does not produce `.`

When the Looking Glass JS evaluator (`Alt+F2 → lg`) has focus, QEMU `sendkey period`
and `sendkey dot` do not insert a literal `.` into the input field. The keystroke
is either silently dropped or the Clutter-based evaluator widget does not handle
it the same way a normal text input would. As a result, chained property access
like `Main.overview.toggle()` ends up as `Mainoverviewtoggle()` — the dots are
missing — and throws `ReferenceError`.

**Workaround:** no reliable `sendkey` fix has been found for this. Use the Super
key approach instead (`key_leftmeta` from a focused app window). If Activities
needs to be opened from inside Looking Glass, close LG first (`sendkey esc`),
return focus to a terminal window, then use `sendkey key_leftmeta`.

**Note on previous success:** `Main.overview.toggle()` via Looking Glass was
successfully used in an earlier session where the dots registered. The difference
may be focus state, GNOME Shell version, or timing — it is not reliable enough to
depend on.

---

### Super key (key_leftmeta) only works when an app window has focus

**This is the biggest gotcha.** `sendkey key_leftmeta` triggers GNOME Activities
**only** when some app window (terminal, browser, etc.) has keyboard focus.
When on the bare desktop with no windows open, GNOME Wayland does not receive
the key event at all — sendkey goes nowhere. Same for Ctrl+Alt+T, hot-corner
mouse move, and typing-to-search.

**Implication:** once you close all windows and land on the empty desktop, you
are stuck. You cannot get back to Activities or open a terminal via QEMU input.
**Reboot** to get a fresh session with livesys-gnome auto-opening Activities.

**Rule:** never close all windows. Always keep at least one terminal open.
Use `terminal &` background launches so the original terminal stays usable.

---

## Mouse Input

### mouse_move coordinates

With `-device usb-tablet`, `mouse_move X Y` takes absolute pixel coordinates
matching the VNC framebuffer resolution (1280×800 in the default live ISO setup).
Coordinates are zero-indexed from the top-left.

### Left click

```bash
printf "mouse_button 1\n" | socat - "UNIX-CONNECT:$SOCK" >/dev/null  # press
printf "mouse_button 0\n" | socat - "UNIX-CONNECT:$SOCK" >/dev/null  # release
```

Always send both press (1) and release (0). Failing to release causes the guest
to think the button is held down.

### Right click

```bash
printf "mouse_button 2\n" | socat - "UNIX-CONNECT:$SOCK" >/dev/null  # press
printf "mouse_button 0\n" | socat - "UNIX-CONNECT:$SOCK" >/dev/null  # release
```

Button mask: 1=left, 2=right, 4=middle (bitmask, can combine).

### Single vs double click

GNOME Activities icons launch on a **single** click. Double-clicking usually
works too but can cause two launches. Use single click with a short sleep after.

### Dock icons in Activities don't respond to QEMU pointer events

Clicking on dock (dash-to-dock) icons while inside the GNOME Activities overview
produces no response via QEMU `mouse_button`. This appears to be how the Shell
compositor routes pointer events to the Clutter layer for the dash-to-dock
extension vs. the standard Wayland surface layer.

**Workaround:** use Activities search + Enter to launch apps instead of clicking
dock icons. To check the running-app dock icon appearance, open Activities via
`sendkey key_leftmeta` (requires an app window to be focused first) and observe
the workspace switcher.

### PowerShell dock identity — confirmed working

When launched from Activities search → Enter, the GNOME Terminal window title
bar shows **"PowerShell"** (not "Terminal"). This confirms that the D-Bus service
file with `app-id=org.azurelinux.PowerShell` is correctly wiring the gnome-terminal
instance to the PowerShell `.desktop` entry. GNOME Shell uses the window title /
app-id to assign dock grouping, so the PowerShell icon in the dock will group
this window correctly.

Note: verifying the dock icon itself (not just the title) requires a real boot
session — QEMU `key_leftmeta` only works when an app window has focus, and once
Activities is opened, `key_leftmeta` stops toggling it back reliably from QEMU
monitor.

The GNOME dock (dash-to-dock) is configured with `intellihide` — it hides when
a window overlaps it. On the bare desktop it **only appears inside the Activities
overview**, not on the plain desktop. The dock does not reveal itself by moving
the mouse to the screen edge from outside Activities.

To reach dock icons without a keyboard Super key:
- Keep an app window open, then `sendkey key_leftmeta` (Super) from inside the
  window to toggle Activities
- Or click the Activities pill (workspace indicator) in the top-left of the
  top bar (~30, 15) — this works when GNOME shell has focus

---

## GNOME Activities and Search

### Auto-open on first boot

`livesys-gnome` opens the Activities overview automatically on the first boot of
a live session. The search box is pre-focused — type immediately, no click needed.
This is the best window to grab dock icons.

### Search opens Terminal/Edit/.NET/PowerShell

Searching "terminal" from Activities returns four icons in this order:
1. Terminal (GNOME Terminal, black `>_` icon)
2. Edit (Microsoft Edit, teal/green diamond)
3. .NET (purple/teal diamond)
4. PowerShell (purple terminal icon)

Press **Enter** to launch the first result (Terminal). Clicking icons directly
from QEMU is unreliable — Enter is more reliable for the first result.

### Terminal launches PowerShell as default shell

GNOME Terminal opens with `PowerShell 7.x.x` as the login shell (`PS /home/liveuser>`
prompt). This is correct — our `/etc/passwd` sets `pwsh` as the default shell for
`liveuser`.

### PowerShell gotcha: `--` in commands

PowerShell intercepts `--` as parameter delimiters. `gh--version` is parsed as a
single token; `gh --version` requires an actual space character typed with
`sendkey spc` (not part of a `fold -w1` loop, which eats spaces — see keyboard
section). Always verify typed commands in the screenshot before waiting for output.

---

## App-specific Notes

### edit (Microsoft Edit)

Launches as a **TUI** (terminal UI) inside GNOME Terminal — not a separate GTK
window. The Terminal window title changes to `Untitled-1.txt - edit`. Close with
**Ctrl+Q**. The `.desktop` icon and search icon both show the correct teal
Microsoft Edit logo.

### VS Code Insiders

Launch: `code-insiders --no-sandbox &` (the `--no-sandbox` flag is required in
the live OverlayFS environment; without it the sandbox setup may fail).
Shows "Welcome to VS Code / Sign in to use GitHub Copilot" on first launch. ✅

### GitHub Desktop

Launch: `github-desktop &`. The process starts and creates a window (visible as
a dark gray rectangle in QEMU). The window content does **not** render under
QEMU virtio-vga/Wayland — the Electron renderer produces a blank canvas.
This is a QEMU test environment limitation; GitHub Desktop renders correctly on
real hardware. The blank window confirms the process starts successfully.

### Microsoft Edge Canary

Launch: `microsoft-edge-canary --no-sandbox &`. Renders correctly in QEMU Wayland
(unlike GitHub Desktop). Shows "Welcome to Microsoft Edge" first-run dialog. ✅

### dotnet

`dotnet --version` fails in QEMU with the default CPU model:
```
Fatal error.
The current CPU is missing one or more of the following instruction sets:
SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, POPCNT
```
**Fix:** launch QEMU with `-cpu host`. This passes through the host CPU's
extensions (any modern x86_64 host has these). Alternatively, use
`-cpu qemu64,+sse4.1,+sse4.2,+popcnt` if host passthrough is not desired.
This is a QEMU test environment limitation — .NET runs fine on real hardware.

### gh / GitHub CLI

`gh --version` works fine in PowerShell with proper spacing. Output:
`gh version 2.96.0 (2026-07-02)`. ✅

### copilot (GitHub Copilot CLI)

`copilot --version` works. First run takes ~6 seconds for package extraction.
Output: `GitHub Copilot CLI 1.0.73.` ✅

## Timing

| Phase | Typical duration (QEMU KVM, 8G RAM) |
|---|---|
| UEFI POST → GRUB | ~3s |
| GRUB timeout | 1s |
| Plymouth (logo + dots) | ~65s |
| Plymouth → black | ~2s |
| GNOME shell loading | ~5s |
| GNOME Activities visible | ~75s total from power-on |

Serial log only shows UEFI output (GRUB and Linux don't redirect to ttyS0 with
`quiet rhgb`). Use screendump polling or `boot-monitor.py` to track Plymouth
and GNOME phases.

---

## Common Failure Modes and Recovery

| Symptom | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| "Display output is not active" | Guest in UEFI/GRUB, OR guest reset | Wait for boot, or check serial log; reboot QEMU if stuck |
| All-black screendump, no message | Plymouth running (display initializing) | Normal — wait |
| key_leftmeta does nothing | No app window focused | Keep terminal open; reboot if all windows closed |
| `sendkey` types wrong char | Timing too fast | Increase sleep between sendkeys (0.07–0.12s works) |
| App launches but window is gray | Electron/Wayland/virtio-vga render failure | QEMU-only issue; test binary presence instead |
| Guest OOM reset | Flatpak install in 4G VM | Use 8G RAM; `--no-static-deltas` does not help with OverlayFS space issue |
| VNC "Address already in use" | Previous QEMU released port slowly | Wait 2s after kill before relaunching |
| Terminal prompt missing after launch | App launched in foreground | Always use `appname &` for GUI apps from terminal |
| `Main.overview.toggle()` fails in Looking Glass (`ReferenceError`) | `sendkey period`/`sendkey dot` drops `.` in Clutter evaluator widget | Close LG (`esc`), return focus to terminal, use `sendkey key_leftmeta` instead |
