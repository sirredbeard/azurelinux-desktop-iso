# microsoft-edit/Flathub side-loads and branding assets get staged into

# Claw-back list: forces these specific base/system packages to resolve
# to Azure Linux's own build instead of Fedora's, on top of the cost=
# tie-break above. cost= only decides between mirrors offering the exact
# same NEVRA - it has no opinion on which repo "owns" a package name when
# the two repos offer genuinely different versions, and Fedora 43 is
# currently ahead of AZL4's frozen beta base for almost every package
# they both ship, so left alone, cost= let Fedora win nearly everything,
# not just the GNOME/GUI stack it's actually needed for. This list is
# scoped to fedora43/fedora43-updates only (excludepkgs on THOSE repos,
# not a blanket dnf5 --exclude=), the same mechanism as the AZL-side
# excludes above, just pointed the other direction: it makes AZL's copy
# the only candidate for these names while leaving Fedora free to win
# everything else, GNOME/GTK/glibc included.
#
# Every package on this list was verified with a real `dnf5 download
# --resolve --alldeps` reproduction (scripts/podman-test-azl4-fedora43.sh)
# before landing here - some real, non-negotiable ABI/version floors
# forced exclusions from this list even though they looked like obvious
# candidates at first:
#   - glibc (and glibc-common/-minimal-langpack/-gconv-extra/-all-
#     langpacks/-langpack-en): gtk4 (a hard dependency of gnome-shell)
#     requires GLIBC_2.43 symbol versioning AZL4's glibc build doesn't
#     provide - confirmed via dnf5's own resolver conflict output. This
#     is the same "hand the whole family to whichever repo can keep it
#     internally consistent" call already made for grub2/shim/fuse3.
#   - wpa_supplicant: has no Azure Linux build at all. Excluding it from
#     Fedora with no AZL fallback doesn't produce a hard failure with
#     --skip-unavailable in play - it just silently disappears from the
#     offline repo, which would have broken WiFi WPA/WPA2 auth. Verified
#     by listing the resulting offline repo directly, not by trusting a
#     clean dnf5 exit code.
#   - fwupd/fwupd-efi: AZL4's fwupd build is ELF-linked against
#     libcbor.so.0.12; gnome-connections (a directly-installed GUI app)
#     pulls in Fedora's freerdp-libs, which is linked against
#     libcbor.so.0.13 - two incompatible sonames of a same-named
#     "libcbor" package can't both be installed at once. Fedora's fwupd
#     build is fully functional (firmware updates aren't laptop-model-
#     specific to who built the package), so it stays on Fedora rather
#     than break gnome-connections. fwupd-efi has no Fedora build at
#     all and resolves to AZL4 either way.
# Sibling library packages that share an exact version-locked NEVRA with
# an already-clawed-back package (util-linux's libblkid/libmount/libuuid/
# libfdisk/libsmartcols, e2fsprogs's libcom_err, xz's xz-libs) are
# included here too - leaving them off this list while clawing back their
# parent package produces the same class of failure fwupd/libcbor did:
# the parent hard-requires its own exact sibling version, but cost= would
# have let Fedora's newer sibling win the tie on its own, breaking the
# parent's dependency. Confirmed ABI-compatible (identical max symbol
# versions in both builds) before adding, unlike the fuse3/libfuse3.so.3-
# vs-.so.4 case, which is a genuine soname fork and is deliberately left
# off this list so both builds can coexist for their respective
# consumers.

# RPMFusion is where the real (patent-encumbered) ffmpeg/h264/aac
# gstreamer plugins come from - Fedora's own gstreamer1-plugins-* builds
# are patent-clean only, same reasoning kickstart/azurelinux-desktop-
# live.ks documents. The live ISO's repo --mirrorlist= form can't be used
# here: `dnf5 download --repofrompath=id,PATH` takes a real baseurl, not
# a mirrorlist redirector (confirmed against dnf5's own --help text), so
# this points straight at a real RPMFusion mirror's release tree instead
# of the mirrorlist CGI. Missing this entirely was the first real gap
# found in a deep-dive comparison against the live ISO: ffmpeg and
# gstreamer1-plugin-libav are both in INSTALL_PKGS but neither Fedora nor Azure
# Linux's own repos carry them, so without this the offline-repo
# download would have silently dropped them and the dry-run validation
# below would have failed the whole build on missing packages.
#
# multilib_policy=best alone did not stop `dnf5 download --alldeps` from
# still pulling in i686 siblings of multilib-capable packages (alldeps
# appears to walk every arch's dependency chain regardless of that
# setopt) - e.g. libpeas1-gtk-1.36.0-13.fc43.i686 next to the .x86_64
# build totem actually needs, which then conflict with each other
# ("has inferior architecture" / "conflicts with libpeas-gtk < 2.0").
# --arch=x86_64,noarch is dnf5 download's own hard architecture filter
# and is what actually keeps i686 packages out (despite the "ARCH,..."
# in dnf5's own --help text, a single comma-joined value is parsed as
# one literal unknown arch string - confirmed it has to be repeated,
# --arch=x86_64 --arch=noarch, to filter to both). This project only
# ever builds/targets x86_64 (see the architecture banner at the top of
# this file) - there's no multilib use case here to keep both arches for.
#
# cost=, not priority=: the live kickstart's own repo lines use `repo
# --cost=1` (AZL/Microsoft repos) and `--cost=50` (Fedora/RPMFusion) -
# cost only breaks ties between repos offering the exact same NEVRA
# (e.g. mirrors), it does not stop dnf from considering a different repo
# entirely for a differently-versioned build of the same package name.
# `--setopt=<repo>.priority=` is a much stronger, different mechanism:
# it excludes every lower-priority repo's candidates outright once a
# higher-priority repo offers a package of that name at all - which,
# combined with excludepkgs on azl-base/azl-microsoft, turned into a
# real bug here. grub2-efi-x64-cdboot and grub2-tools-extra are each
# tightly version-pinned to sibling packages (grub2-common, grub2-tools-
# minimal) from their own build; with azl-base pinned to priority=1,
# dnf5 insisted on azl-base's own grub2-efi-x64-cdboot candidate and
# then hard-failed on its excluded sibling dependency instead of falling
# through to Fedora's self-consistent grub2 family, which never has
# that problem since all of Fedora's grub2 packages are excluded/
# included as one full set. Switching these setopts to cost=, matching
# the live kickstart's own repo config exactly, resolves the same way
# the live ISO's real anaconda install does: azl-base/azl-microsoft
# candidates are still tried first for anything not excluded, but a
# whole-family exclude on one repo cleanly falls through to the other
# repo's complete, self-consistent set instead of that repo's partial
# candidate list hard-failing the transaction.
